## How to Use This Backlog

This is the **single source of truth** for all outstanding work on Reese Reviews — for both human contributors and AI agents.

### For Humans (Audrey / Team Members)
1. Add new items in the **📥 Inbox** section at the bottom.
2. Move items to the correct priority tier after review.
3. Assign an owner and update the status column when work starts.
4. Mark items `Done` and log the completion date.

### For AI Agents
1. **Read this file before writing any code.**
2. Pick the **highest-priority `To Do`** item in the current sprint tier.
3. Update the item status to `In Progress` with your session date.
4. Complete the task. Run tests. Push your changes.
5. Update the item to `Done` with the PR/commit reference.
6. Update `docs/scrum/HANDOFF.md` before ending your session.
7. **Do not start a new item until the current one is verified complete.**

> ⚠️ **Rule:** One item per agent session. Finish it completely before moving on.  
> ⚠️ **Rule:** If a task is too large to finish in one session, break it into sub-tasks here first.
