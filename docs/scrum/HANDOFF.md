# Handoff Guide — Reese Reviews

**Date:** April 3, 2026
**Standard:** revvel-standards/MASTER_APP_TEMPLATE.md (Phase 8: Release)

---

## 1. Introduction

This document provides a comprehensive takeover guide for any new developer joining the `reese-reviews.com` project. It outlines the system architecture, required credentials, local setup instructions, and key workflows.

---

## 2. System Architecture

The application is a unified business management and automated review platform built for the "Reese" persona. It integrates Amazon Vine tracking, an ERP Tax Center, and an avatar-based review generation pipeline.

### Core Technologies

*   **Frontend:** React 18, Vite, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS (Glassmorphism UI).
*   **State Management:** Custom stores (`src/stores/`) interacting with Supabase.
*   **Backend & Database:** Supabase (PostgreSQL, Auth, Storage, Edge Functions).
*   **Hosting:** DigitalOcean App Platform (Static Site, SPA routing).
*   **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`, `deploy.yml`), CodeRabbit AI PR reviews.

### Key Integrations

*   **OpenRouter API:** Powers the AI review generation and metadata stripping (`src/services/openRouterService.ts`).
*   **YouTube Data API v3:** Handles automated video publishing and scheduling (`src/services/youtube/youtubeService.ts`).
*   **Plaid & Stripe:** Scaffolded for bank linking and subscription management (UI present, backend pending).

## 3. Local Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to run the application locally.

### Prerequisites

1.  Node.js (v22 recommended) and npm.
2.  A Supabase project with the schema applied (`supabase/migrations/20260403_team_a_persistence_migration.sql`).
3.  An OpenRouter API key.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/midnghtsapphire/reese-reviews.git
    cd reese-reviews
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm ci
    ```

3.  **Configure environment variables:**
    Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` and fill in your Supabase and OpenRouter credentials.
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

4.  **Start the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    The application will be available at `http://localhost:5173`.

## 4. Key Workflows

### Development & Deployment

The project follows the Revvel Concurrent Development Standard.

1.  Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feat/your-feature-name`.
2.  Commit your changes frequently.
3.  Push your branch and open a Pull Request against `main`.
4.  CodeRabbit will automatically review your PR. Address any comments.
5.  The CI pipeline (lint, typecheck, test, build) must pass before merging.
6.  Upon merge to `main`, the application automatically deploys to DigitalOcean.
7.  **NEVER force-push.** Use `git rebase` to resolve conflicts.

### Review Generation Pipeline

The core value of the application is the automated review generation pipeline.

1.  **Import:** Users import Amazon Vine items via CSV or manual entry.
2.  **Generate:** The `ReviewPublishingWizard` guides the user through generating AI content using OpenRouter.
3.  **Assemble:** An avatar (stock or custom) is selected, and media is uploaded to Supabase Storage.
4.  **Publish:** The finalized review is published to the site and optionally auto-posted to YouTube.

## 6. New Documents Added (April 5, 2026)

The following documents were added to address the compliance and agent-completion issues raised in GitHub Issue #issue:

| Document | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| [`docs/BACKLOG.md`](../BACKLOG.md) | **Master product backlog.** Single source of truth for all outstanding work. Agents and users must read this first and update it on every session. |
| [`docs/AGENT_COMPLETION_GUIDE.md`](../AGENT_COMPLETION_GUIDE.md) | **Why agents don't finish apps.** Root cause analysis + the playbook to guarantee completion. Required reading for all agents. |
| [`docs/ROLLOUT_PLAN.md`](../ROLLOUT_PLAN.md) | **Safe live-app rollout procedures.** Risk-tiered deployment strategy + rollback procedures for all failure scenarios. |

### What Was Completed This Session (April 5, 2026 — Sprint 4 third iteration)
- **RR-404 ✅** — Stripe subscription checkout finalized:
  - New `src/lib/stripeClient.ts`: `getStripe()` lazy singleton, `isStripeConfigured()`, `redirectToCheckout()` (Payment Link redirect + Stripe.js fallback), `getSubscriptionState()`/`saveSubscriptionState()` (localStorage + Supabase `user_profiles.preferences` sync), `activateTier()`, `handleCheckoutReturn()`.
  - `src/components/payments/PaymentsDashboard.tsx` fully rewritten: `alert()` stub replaced with real async checkout with loading spinner; return-URL handler (`?success=true`/`?canceled=true`); active-plan badge per tier; demo-mode warning banner; Plaid tab now uses full `PlaidBankConnect` component.
  - `.env.example` updated with `VITE_STRIPE_LINK_PRO` / `VITE_STRIPE_LINK_BUSINESS`.
  - `@stripe/stripe-js` installed (v9.0.1).
- **RR-406 ✅** — TypeDoc added to build pipeline:
  - `typedoc.json` config at repo root; entry points: `src/lib`, `src/stores`, `src/services`.
  - `"docs": "typedoc"` script added to `package.json`.
  - `docs/api/` added to `.gitignore`.
  - New `docs` CI job in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs after `typecheck`, generates docs, and uploads as artifact.
- **RR-409 ✅** — Marked done; `App.tsx` already fully lazy-loads all route-level pages with `React.lazy()` + `Suspense`.

### What's Next (Highest Priority for Next Session)

1. **RR-405** — Implement Meta Business API auto-post (Medium) — `src/components/marketing/MetaAutoPost.tsx`
2. **RR-503** — Add TSDoc comments to all `src/lib/*.ts` files (Medium, required for TypeDoc quality)
3. **RR-504** — Add TSDoc comments to all `src/services/*.ts` files (Medium)
4. **RR-505** — Fix remaining ESLint errors (all remaining `any` types)

> Next agent: **read `docs/BACKLOG.md` first.** Pick the highest-priority `To Do` item. Update its status. Update this HANDOFF.md when done.

*   **Supabase Issues:** Verify your `.env` credentials and ensure RLS policies are correctly configured. Check the Supabase dashboard logs for errors.
*   **Build Failures:** The CI pipeline runs `npx tsc --noEmit` and `npm run build`. Ensure all TypeScript errors are resolved locally before pushing.
*   **Deployment Errors:** Check the DigitalOcean App Platform deployment logs. Ensure the `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` and `VITE_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` environment variables are set in the DigitalOcean dashboard.
*   **Standards:** Refer to the `revvel-standards` repository for detailed guidelines on code review, auto-documentation, and the master app template.
